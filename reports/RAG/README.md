7.1. Challenges and Trends
Wearable technologies for CVD monitoring signiﬁcantly help drive down the costs of
in-hospital treatments. In terms of continuous and outpatient monitoring, smart wearables
improve diagnosis precision, thus providing patients with convenient solutions for self-
care through the ongoing monitoring of biomedical variables during daily routines. CVD
monitoring techniques greatly vary, and their usability depends mostly on the type of
condition to be prevented or managed and the type of monitoring. For instance, ECG
and PPG are generally implemented for continuous and ambulatory monitoring in ﬁtness
bands and smartwatches. ECG is a test widely recommended in the follow-up of some
heart diseases. It involves the recording of heart electrical activity through the surface of
the patient’s body. Then, based on the difference in electrical potential between two distant
points of the body, ECG can measure a series of biomedical variables to detect heart diseases
such as heart failure and arrhythmias. However, ECG technology is not recommended for
monitoring the risk of heart attack. In this case, conventional electrocardiography with
electrodes remains the best option.
PPG is another technique for monitoring CVD biomedical variables. It involves
injecting photons into human body tissue and analyzing the reﬂected light. PPG has
proved to yield better results when performed at the wrist level via bands or smartwatches,
which are unobtrusive devices that patients can conveniently carry with them during
day-to-day activities. As its main setback, PPG has little robustness and reliability during
physical activity or when the patient is in motion.
In addition to ECG and PPG, other techniques are used to monitor important heartbeat
information, such as ballistocardiography (BCG) and phonocardiography (PCG). BCG is a
technique used to measure ballistic forces generated by the heart. The technique produces
a graphical representation of repetitive movements of the human body that arise as blood
is suddenly ejected into the great vessels with each heartbeat. BCG is usually integrated
into smart wearables using highly sensitive accelerometers connected to the patient’s body
surface, usually the torso. In turn, PCG technology can be used to record heart sounds.
Unfortunately, since both BCG and PCG are sensitive to ambient noise, it is unlikely that
we will ﬁnd them integrated into current wearable devices.
The skin covers most of the human body, so it serves as an optimal mode for
noninvasive wearable devices for medical care. Skin-based wearable devices can be used
for physiological and psychological monitoring for the treatment of different diseases,
for example, CVDs. In addition, it can also be used for the diagnosis of different diseases
through the qualitative and quantitative analysis of skin secretions, such as sweat. In
the case of epidermal wearable devices, they imply the direct union to the skin, such
as a tattoo, generally known as electronic skin (e-skin). E-skin is made with flexible
electronic components, such as conductive links (e.g., liquid metal alloys for printing
ultrathin circuits, graphene, gold nanorods, or various polymers with a rubber backing),
allowing each patient to be managed as a separate database of medical information,
which is relevant to the medical staff caring for them. When an e-skin is inserted into
the patient’s skin, it can record information about the patient’s biomedical variables
through its small electrodes and simultaneously send such data to smartphones or other
connected devices. In addition, e-skin can receive energy from the electrophysiological
processes of the human body, making it possible to work without batteries. E-skin
adapts to any shape and even works if bent, twisted, or stretched, since it has properties
similar to those of light fabrics; that is, e-skin adapts to the flexibility of the human
body, which is an advantage over conventional wearable devices. This noninvasive
medical technology could allow healthcare experts to monitor and diagnose arrhythmia
problems, heart activities of premature babies, sleep disorders, and brain activity, among
other diseases.

##### Answer:

```
The use of ECG to measure heart rate and rhythm has several advantages. First, it is a
noninvasive test, which means that it does not require any incision or insertion of electrodes
into the body. This makes it more comfortable for patients and reduces the risk of infection
or other complications associated with invasive tests. Second, ECG is a quick and easy
test to perform, requiring only a few minutes to obtain accurate readings. Third, ECG can
monitor heart rate and rhythm continuously, providing real-time information on the patient’s
cardiovascular health. Fourth, ECG is a widely accepted and standardized test, with well-
established criteria for interpreting the results. This means that the data obtained from an ECG
test can be easily compared to established norms and standards, allowing for accurate
diagnosis and treatment of heart conditions. Finally, ECG is a relatively inexpensive test,
making it accessible to a wide range of patients and healthcare settings.
In conclusion, ECG is a valuable tool for measuring heart rate and rhythm, with several
advantages over other techniques. Its noninvasive nature, quick and easy performance,
continuous monitoring capabilities, standardization, and affordability make it an ideal
choice for a wide range of patients and healthcare settings. As technology continues to

#### Question: Using ECG to predict diabetes, what features in the training of a machine learning model are the most important?

39 Kulkarni AR, et al. BMJ Innov 2023;9:32–42. doi:10.1136/bmjinnov-2021-000759Digital health
of ECG as a predictor of diabetes in the context of
ML or DL has been infrequent and very recent. Our study differs from the previous attempts in this direc-tion in the following ways. First, previous studies have relied on the fact that heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of autonomic regulation of the heart func-tion, is affected in diabetes.
47 While this is certainly
true, the cardiac affliction in diabetes is also a result of the structural damage to myocardium.
14 Our study
used ECG in such way that information from both the structural and functional abnormalities could be included in training. For example, we did not explic-itly extract HRV-
 related
features (time and frequency
domain) and used that as input to training as previous studies
17 48–53 have done. Rather, we extracted beats
and used the time-
 aligned
features of these beats as
inputs for training. This approach permitted the inclu-sion of both HRV-
 related and HR
V-
 unrelated beat
morphology
to be used for model training. Second, all
previous studies have focused on a sequence of heart beats rather than a single beat as a unit of analysis as used in this study. Consequently, the speed of diag-nosis is greatly improved in our approach. Third, the accuracy of diabetes detection has varied in previous studies within the range of 86%–95%.
17 49–53 T wo
recent studies in this regard are also important. The study by Porumb et al
18 did use heartbeat as the unit
of analysis but was designed to detect hypoglycaemic events in the context of continuous glucose moni-toring while the second study
54 used DL techniques to
achieve an accuracy of 77% for detection of diabetes. Our estimate of 97% accuracy in the independent test set is a further improvement as compared with the previous studies.
17 18 49–54 Last few years have seen an upsurge in the concept of using ML methods to detect pre-
 diabetes.
For example, Wang et al20 devel-
oped the IGRNet model—an extensive DL model—to predict pre-
 diabetes
from ECG images with high
accuracy. Also, Bent et al55 have recently published a
proof of concept study to demonstrate how the wear -
able smartwatches can be combined with ML methods to remotely monitor HbA1c and interstitial glucose concentrations. Similarly, Zhu et al
56 have developed
an impedance based DS21 tool to detect diabetes. Also, a large study (n=27
 779) by K
engne et al57 inves-
tigated the ability of 12 non-
 invasive risk score models
to predict
type 2 diabetes and found the accuracy to lie
in the range 0.76–0.81. Using the rich waveform data recorded by digital ECG machines, our study was able to detect pre-
 diabetes
with a very high accuracy both
in the validation and independent test sets thereby providing a potential candidate for population-
 level
screening. T
ogether, our study provides an ECG-
 driven
ML
model that is fast and accurate in predicting both
diabetes and pre-
 diabetes.
 Notably
, our XGBoost-
 based DiaBeats classifier
was
the best performing algorithm as compared other
ML models or DL models. Algorithmically, XGBoost represents an ensemble approach based on decision-

tree analytical
framework. This algorithm has several
advantages like hardware optimisation and speed, a parallelised tree-
 building process, tree pruning
using a
depth-
 first approach and, most importantly
, L1 and L2
regularisation to reduce or avert overfitting. The value of this increasingly popular algorithm in clinical clas-sification tasks is demonstrated in two recent, elegant reviews.
58 59 An important observation from our anal -
yses was the performance superiority of XGBoost over mainstream DL models (online supplemental table 1). Regardless of the depth and complexity of the DL models considered in this study XGBoost was faster and more accurate as compared with other DL models for time series classification task undertaken in this study. A similar observation has recently been reported for time series forecasting also.
60 The classifi -
cation superiority of XGBoost, however, should not be considered as a generalisation of its algorithmic capa-bility in comparison to the DL models studied here. It is conceivable that the tabular representation of the preprocessed beat data, mitigation of the potential long-
 range time series features by clipping the ECG
signals into individual heartbeats and the inherent nature
of the classification problem may have made
DL models somewhat redundant for this classification task. Future studies need to evaluate the formal algo-rithmic aspects of the ML/DL models that provide the best results for a given problem and dataset.
Our study has limitations. First, by way of design,
the DISFIN study enrolled high-
 risk individuals and

therefore the prevalence of metabolic conditions shown in table

1 cannot be considered reflective of
a general population prevalence. This is important

To answer your question, the most important features in using ECG to predict diabetes using machine learning models are:
1. Time-aligned features of beats: The study used beats as the unit of analysis and extracted time-aligned features of these beats as inputs for training the machine learning model.
2. Both HRV-related and HRV-unrelated beat morphology: The study did not explicitly extract HRV-related features (time and frequency domain) and used the time-aligned features of beats as inputs for training. This approach permitted the inclusion of both HRV-related and HRV-unrelated beat morphology.
3. Structural damage to myocardium: The study used ECG in a way that information from both the structural and functional abnormalities could be included in training.
4. High-quality ECG recordings: The study used high-quality ECG recordings to ensure accurate feature extraction and model performance.
5. Large sample size: The study had a large sample size (n=390) to improve the accuracy of the model.
6. Machine learning algorithm: The study used an XGBoost-based machine learning model, which is an ensemble approach based on decision-tree analytical framework, and has several advantages like hardware optimization and speed, parallelized tree-building process, tree pruning using a depth-first approach, and L1 and L2 regularization to reduce or avert overfitting.
7. Model performance evaluation: The study evaluated the performance of the machine learning model using various metrics and compared it with other machine learning and deep learning models.
8. Clinical validation: The study conducted a clinical validation of the model using an independent test set to assess its accuracy in predicting diabetes.

In summary, the most important features in using ECG to predict diabetes using machine learning models are time-aligned features of beats, both HRV-related and HRV-unrelated beat morphology, high-quality ECG recordings, large sample size, machine learning algorithm, model performance evaluation, and clinical validation.

Global Burden of Disease
The AHA works with the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation to help derive annual statistics for the AHA Sta -
tistical Update. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and
Risk Factors Study is an ongoing global effort to quantify
health loss from hundreds of causes and risks from 1990
to the present for all countries. The study seeks to produce
consistent and comparable estimates of population health
over time and across locations, including summary metrics
such as DAL Ys and healthy life expectancy. Results are
made available to policymakers, researchers, governments,
and the public with the overarching goals of improving pop -
ulation health and reducing health disparities.
GBD 2020, the most recent iteration of the study, was
produced by the collective efforts of more than 7500
researchers in more than 150 countries. Estimates were
produced for 370 causes and 88 risk factors.
During each annual GBD Study cycle, population health
estimates are reproduced for the full time series. For GBD
2020, estimates were produced for 1990 to 2020 for
204 countries and territories, stratified by age and sex,
with subnational estimates made available for an increas -
ing number of countries. Improvements in statistical and geospatial modeling methods and the addition of new data
sources may lead to changes in results across GBD Study
cycles for both the most recent and earlier years.

##### Answer:

```
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) kill approximately 40 million people annually.
This number is projected to increase to 50 million by 2030, with NCDs accounting for 75% of all deaths worldwide.
The leading causes of NCDs include heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, which are responsible for over 15 million deaths each year.
Other leading causes of NCDs include cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and motor vehicle accidents.
The economic burden of NCDs is significant, with estimated costs of over $1 trillion annually, including direct medical costs and lost productivity.
The WHO emphasizes the importance of addressing the underlying causes of NCDs, such as tobacco use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets, in order to reduce the global burden of these diseases.

ORIGINAL RESEARCH
ARTICLENovember 8, 2022 Circulation. 2022;146:1415–1424. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.060291 1416
Lubitz et al Wearable-Based Detection of Atrial Fibrillationfrom AF.3,4 Because AF can be paroxysmal and asymp-
tomatic, wearable devices may help identify individuals
with undiagnosed AF.
Newer smartwatch and fitness tracker models typi-
cally include an optical photoplethysmography (PPG)
sensor to measure pulse rate. Algorithms can analyze for
pulse irregularity from the PPG data and infer the pres-
ence of AF. Optimizing these algorithms for use in con-
sumer wearable devices at scale is critical, because false
positives might lead to anxiety, increased use of health
care resources, and treatment side effects.
The reported clinical trial and regulatory metric for
evaluating algorithm performance has been the posi-
tive predictive value (PPV) for AF during simultaneous
ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in 2 previ-
ous large-scale validation studies of wrist-worn wearable
device–based algorithms that relied on intermittent PPG
data.5,6 For example, the Apple Heart Study included >400 000 Apple Watch users and found that, among
those receiving an irregular rhythm notification, 34% had
AF >30 seconds identified on subsequent ECG patch
monitoring with an 84% PPV of the algorithm for con-
current AF on the ECG patch. The algorithm was subse-
quently cleared in the United States and received a CE
mark in Europe for over-the-counter use.7, 8
We designed a novel algorithm to use more frequent
sampling of PPG data and stricter criteria for irregular
rhythm detection. We conducted a large-scale single-
arm remote clinical trial to test whether the algorithm
would achieve a high PPV for detecting undiagnosed AF
in users of an array of wrist-worn smartwatches and fit-
ness trackers from a single manufacturer. We additionally
assessed the probability of a confirmed diagnosis of new
AF on a subsequent 1-week ECG patch monitor after
detection of an irregular heart rhythm by the algorithm.
METHODS
Individual-level data from the study will not be made available
because of participant confidentiality and privacy, and company
policy regarding user data, as well.
Study Design and Participants
The study design has been described previously.9 This was a
single-arm remote clinical trial. We invited Fitbit device users
aged at least 22 years to enroll between May 6 and October
1, 2020. Participants were eligible if they were US residents
and used a compatible Fitbit device (Ionic, Charge 3, Charge
4, Versa, Versa Lite, Versa 2, Versa 3, Sense, Inspire HR, or
Inspire 2) with a paired Fitbit account and an Android or Apple
iOS smartphone with installed Fitbit app. A valid phone number
and email address were required for participation. All partici-
pants were required to confirm that they met eligibility criteria
for the trial, including that they had not been diagnosed with
AF, used oral anticoagulants, or had a pacemaker or defibrilla-
tor. Participants were invited to participate through email, Fitbit
app notifications, social media, and other marketing channels.
All participants provided informed consent through smartphone
or web. The protocol was approved by the Advarra Institutional
Review Board (Columbia, MD). The protocol is available in the
Supplemental Material.
Procedures
The novel algorithm ran centrally on a server using routinely
collected PPG data after device syncing through the smart-
phone. The algorithm was unlocked centrally only for users
who consented to the study. The algorithm analyzed PPG data
continuously during periods in which participants were sta-
tionary (as determined by device accelerometers), to minimize
motion artifact and thereby reduce the likelihood of false-pos-
itive AF detections. The PPG data were analyzed as 5-minute
pulse tachograms acquired every 2.5 minutes (ie, overlap-
ping by 50%). If 11 consecutive tachograms were classified
as irregular, then an irregular heart rhythm detection (IHRD)
was generated (Figure S1). The algorithm therefore required
at least 30 minutes of a sensed irregular heart rhythm to Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• A novel photoplethysmography algorithm for wear-
able devices requires at least 30 continuous min-
utes of an irregular rhythm to generate an irregular
heart rhythm detection during periods of inactivity
(to minimize motion artifact).
• The novel algorithm can enable large-scale identi-
fication of undiagnosed atrial fibrillation with a high
positive predictive value during periods of inactivity.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The Fitbit wearable-based irregular heart rhythm
algorithm may be useful for early detection of undi-
agnosed atrial fibrillation.
• Individuals with a Fitbit wearable-based irregular
heart rhythm detection have a substantial likelihood
of having atrial fibrillation confirmed on a subse-
quent ECG patch monitor and considerable burden
of atrial fibrillation.
• Because wearable-based irregular heart rhythm
detections using photoplethysmography sensors
operate during periods of inactivity, wearing devices
at night may maximize the sensitivity.
• Detection of atrial fibrillation during periods of
active motion remains a challenge.

levels. Both of them cause in cells not to assimilate the sugar and, as a
consequence, there is a rise in blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia. Several
types of diabetes diﬀer in origin. According to the ADA (American Diabetes
Association) we can distinguish four types of diabetes:
•Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM): Cells do not produce insulin because of an
autoimmune process. Currently, requires the person to inject insulin
or wear an insulin pump.
•Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM): Results from insulin resistance, where cells
fail to use insulin properly, sometimes combined with an absolute in-
sulin deﬁciency.
•Gestational Diabetes: appears in the gestation period in one out of
ten pregnant women. Pregnancy is a change in the body’s metabolism,
since the fetus uses the mother’s energy for food, oxygen and others.
This causes a decrease in the secretion of insulin from the mother.
•Other Types: such as problems on β-cells, genetic defects aﬀecting
insulin action, induced by drugs, genetic syndroms, etc.
In most cases, diabetic patients with long time evolution need exogenous
insulin either injected into various injection doses, or introduced by an insulin
pump. It is important to maintain good glycemic control to prevent not only
from the acute complications speciﬁc to diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis and
hypoglycemia, deﬁned as blood glucose value less than 70 mg/dl ), but also
from a set of multi-chronic complications associated with diabetic patients:
nephropathy, retinopathy, microangiopathy and macroangiopathy.
In recent years, it has been shown that a strict glycemic control in crit-
ically ill patients improves performance and reduces medical costs [1] [2].
Glucose levels control is a demanding and diﬃcult task for both patients
and their families. To keep good levels of blood glucose, the patient must
have some capacity of prediction to know what level of glucose would have
if ingested a certain amount of food or injected with a quantity of a insulin
of a certain kind. In fact, the objective is to avoid not only long periods
of hyperglycemia (glucose levels ≥120mg/dl ) but also episodes of severe
hypoglycemia (glucose levels ≤40mg/dl ) that can lead to patient death.
One of the aspects that make it diﬃcult to control blood glucose level is
the lack of a general model of response to both insulin and the various factors

000 mg/dl or less, which is a sign of diabetes.
In general, a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dl or higher indicates
that a person has diabetes. However, some people with diabetes may have
normal fasting blood glucose levels, especially if they have been diagnosed
Recently, there has been some debate about the usefulness of the A1C
test, which measures average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3
months. Some experts argue that the A1C test is a better indicator of
diabetes than a single fasting blood glucose level, because it takes into
account the high variability in blood glucose levels throughout the day.
However, other experts argue that the A1C test is not as accurate as
single fasting blood glucose level, because it can be aﬀected by factors such as
body weight, blood loss, and medications.
In conclusion, a fasting blood glucose level of 120 mg/dl or higher
indicates that a person has diabetes, but it is important to consider other
factors, such as the A1C test, to get a more accurate diagnosis.

Abstract —Control of blood glucose is essential for diabetes
management. Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects
with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artiﬁcial
pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning
techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved
control. Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare
and medical research to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range
of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient state prediction
among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model
that is capable of forecasting glucose levels with leading accuracy
for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38 ±0.71 [mg/dL] over
a 30-minute horizon, RMSE = 18.87 ±2.25 [mg/dL] over a 60-
minute horizon) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.07 ±2.35
[mg/dL] for 30-minute, RMSE = 33.27 ±4.79% for 60-minute).
In addition, the model provides competitive performance in
providing effective prediction horizon ( PH eff) with minimal time
lag both in a simulated patient dataset ( PH eff= 29.0 ±0.7 for
30-min and PH eff= 49.8 ±2.9 for 60-min) and in a real patient
dataset ( PH eff= 19.3 ±3.1 for 30-min and PH eff= 29.3 ±9.4
for 60-min). This approach is evaluated on a dataset of 10
simulated cases generated from the UVa/Padova simulator and a
clinical dataset of 10 real cases each containing glucose readings,
insulin bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data. Performance of the
recurrent convolutional neural network is benchmarked against
four algorithms. The proposed algorithm is implemented on an
Android mobile phone, with an execution time of 6ms on a phone
compared to an execution time of 780ms on a laptop.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Diabetes is a chronic illness characterised by the absence of
glucose homeostasis. A healthy pancreas dynamically controls
the release of insulin and glucagon hormones through the α-
cells andβ-cells respectively, in order to maintain euglycaemia
[1]. In Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, the β-
cells are compromised and therefore suffer from impaired
production of insulin. This leads to periods of hyperglycaemia
( persistent blood glucose (BG) concentration >180mg/dL )
and hypoglycaemia ( BG concentration <70mg/dL ) [2], [3].
Insulin therapy is needed to maintain BG levels in the advised
target range [4].
The standard approach to diabetes management requires
people actively taking BG measurements a handful of times
throughout the day with a ﬁnger prick test - self monitor-
ing of blood glucose. The recent development and uptake
of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices allow for
improved sampling (5 minutes) of glucose measurements [5].
This approach has proven to be effective in controlling BG
and thus improving the outcome of subjects in clinical trials[6]. Further improvement of glucose control can be realised
through prediction, which allows users to take actions ahead of
time in order to minimise the occurrence of adverse glycaemic
events. The challenges lie in multiple factors that inﬂuence
glucose variability, such as insulin variability, ingested meals,
stress and other physical activities [7]. In addition, individual
glycaemic responses are conditioned by high subject variabil-
ity [4], [8], leading to different responses between individuals
under the same conditions.
Machine learning (ML) allows intelligent systems to build
appropriate models by learning and extracting patterns in
data. The models discover mappings from the representation
of input data to the output. Performances of traditional ma-
chine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbours [9], or support vector regression [10] heavily rely
on the representation of the data they are given. Typically, the
features - information the representation comprises - are en-
gineered with prior knowledge and statistical features (mean,
variance) [11], principal component analysis (PCA) [12] or
linear discriminant analysis [13]. Artiﬁcial neural networks
(ANN) are also investigated widely in diabetes management
[14]–[18]. One advantage of ANN is that, normally no hand-
craft feature ﬁnding is required. However, ANN in the liter-
ature are mostly implemented fewer than 3 layers, hence its
learning capacity is limited due to the model complexity. Deep
learning, which incorporates multi-layer neural networks, has
lead to signiﬁcant progresses in computer vision [19], diseases
diagnosis [20], and healthcare [21], [22]. Deep learning shows
superior performance to traditional ML techniques due to this
ability to automatically learn features with higher complexity
and representations [23]–[26]. As a result, it encodes features
that might not be previously known to researchers.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning algorithm for
glucose prediction using a multi-layer convolutional recurrent
neural network (CRNN) architecture. The model is primarily
trained on data comprising CGM, carbohydrate and insulin
data. After preprocessing, the time-aligned multi-dimensional
time series data of BG, carbohydrate and insulin (other factors
also can be considered) are fed to CRNN for training. The
architecture of the CRNN is composed of three parts: a multi-
layer convolutional neural network that extracts the data fea-
tures using convolution and pooling, followed by a recurrent
neural network (RNN) layer with long short term memory
(LSTM) cells and fully-connected layers. The model is trained
end-to-end. The convolutional layer comprises a 1D Gaussian
kernel ﬁlter to perform the temporal convolution, and pooling
layers are used for reducing the feature set. A variant of LSTMarXiv:1807.03043v5  [cs.CV]  25 Feb 2019

Answer: The results are shown in the table above, and the annotations are color-coded according to the categories defined in the legend.

Answer: The article is discussing the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the trait "regional goat-like behavior" (RG) in a population of individuals.
The study used a statistical method called "epigenetic annotation" to identify regions of the genome that are associated with the trait.
The results of the analysis are shown in an extended data figure, which includes a table with the results of the epigenetic annotation for each of the 2,040 annotations considered in the study.
The table shows the results of the analysis for each annotation, with the results color-coded according to the categories defined in the legend.

Explanation:

* "goated sigma level 9000 rizzler with a skibidi gyatt" is likely a fictional or humorous term, and is not a real scientific concept.
* "pay fanum tax and touch grass" is also likely a fictional or humorous term, and is not a real scientific concept.
* "Nature Genetics" is a scientific journal that publishes research on genetics and related fields.
* "RG GWAS" stands for "regional goat-like behavior genome-wide association study".
* "GARFIELD" is a software tool used for epigenetic annotation, which is the process of identifying and interpreting epigenetic marks (such as DNA methylation or histone modifications) in a genome.
* "enrichment analysis" is a statistical method used to identify overrepresented categories of genes or other features in a dataset.
* "Bonferroni corrected" refers to a statistical method used to adjust the significance level of a test to account for multiple comparisons.
* "2,040 annotations" refers to the number of regions of the genome that were considered in the epigenetic annotation analysis.
* "color-coded" refers to the way the results of the epigenetic annotation are presented in the table, with different colors used to represent different categories of results.

```
*goated* = goat-like
*sigma level 9000* = a made-up number used to describe something that is very advanced or impressive
*rizzler* = a made-up word that could be used to describe something that is cool or impressive
*skibidi gyatt* = a made-up word that could be used to describe something that is very fast or powerful
*fanum tax* = a made-up word that could be used to describe a fictional tax or fee
*touch grass* = a phrase used to describe something that is mundane or ordinary

So, the question is asking if you are a highly advanced or impressive being,

#### Question: What is mitochondrial dysfunction and how can you prevent it?

##### Context:

1 3hypertrophy, HF, cardiac ischemia–reperfusion injury, and
diabetic cardiomyopathy (reviewed in [ 175, 189, 193, 275]).
Additionally,  Ca2+ can stimulate nitric oxide synthase
(NOS), generating reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that can
further enhance ROS production [ 36, 133]. Therefore,  Ca2+
and ROS form a vicious cycle that can induce membrane
depolarization, mitochondrial protein and DNA damage,
mPTP opening, and cell death. Alterations in energy and
ROS/Ca2+ coupling have been observed in HF, supporting
the importance of  Ca2+ in modulating energy and ROS pro -
duction [ 209]. Antioxidant daily injection in mice models
of T1DM and T2DM resulted in reduced oxidative stress
and myocyte apoptosis, and restoration of diastolic function
[204]. Mice lacking p66shc, a protein involved in ROS pro -
duction [ 108], are protected from STZ-induced diastolic and
systolic dysfunction, reducing diabetes induced cell apopto -
sis and necrosis [ 232]. Furthermore, hyperglycemia induces
mitochondrial oxidative stress and mitochondrial fragmenta -
tion, which can cause cellular injury and dysfunction [ 307].
It is known that when mitochondrial  Ca2+ overload
occurs, the mPTP can open, resulting in the release of mito -
chondrial content (including  Ca2+) and causing cell death
[17]. Indeed, it was shown that FUNDC1 is upregulated
in diabetic human hearts and Akita and STZ animal mod -
els of T1DM. The increased FUNDC1 is associated with
increased MAM formation by binding to IP3R2, resulting in
increased mitochondrial  Ca2+ levels, mitochondrial dysfunc -
tion, increased ROS formation, and decreased mitochondrial
membrane potential, while FUNDC1 deletion protected
mice from cardiac dysfunction [ 294]. Mitochondrial  Ca2+
overload due to SR  Ca2+ leak can cause mitochondria dys -
function, oxidative stress, and apoptosis as seen in HF [ 240].
As discussed above, CaMKII was overactivated in several
models of diabetic cardiomyopathy producing RyR2 phos -
phorylation and increasing SR  Ca2+ leak [ 93, 248, 261];
additionally, CaMKII may directly favor mitochondria  Ca2+
uptake increasing MCU activity; however, this is a contro -
versial issue that deserves further investigation [ 103, 137,
181, 205, 270]. Activated CaMKII phosphorylates Drp-1, a
mitochondrial membrane protein, which results in increased
mPTP opening, myocyte death, and heart hypertrophy after
β-adrenergic stimulation [ 302]. This phosphorylation was
also observed in ventricular samples from dilated cardiomy -
opathy and ischemic heart failure patients [ 302]. Increased
Drp-1 acetylation has been also detected in obese Zucker and
HFD fed mice, monkeys, and isolated myocytes treated with
palmitate [ 128] resulting in heart dysfunction, mitochon -
drial fission, and cell death mediated by VDAC-1. Initiation
of cell death by mitochondria in response to diverse stress
signals, like hypoxia, oxidative stress, and  Ca2+ overload,
can be induced by opening of the mPTP, resulting in loss of
ΔΨm and mitochondrial swelling or by permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane and release of proapop -
totic proteins [ 117].
On the other hand, reduced SR  Ca2+ load and  Ca2+ tran-
sients result in decreased mitochondrial  Ca2+ uptake [ 145].
Reduced mitochondrial  Ca2+ content also has deleterious
effects on mitochondrial function. It can further reduce
PDH phosphatase activity, resulting in decreased glucose
and increased fatty acid utilization, increasing lactate pro -
duction, oxygen consumption, and eventually altering con -
tractile function [ 79]. Suarez et al. [ 262] described that
reduced mitochondrial  Ca2+ in diabetic cardiomyopathy
due to reduced MCU expression results in reduced ΔΨm,
increased ROS, and apoptosis in STZ-treated mice. Addi -
tionally, reduced cytosolic  Ca2+ transients can reduce mito -
chondrial  Ca2+ content, affecting ATP generation as seen in
T1DM hearts [ 158, 308]. Reduced  Ca2+ retention capacity as
a result of increased sensitivity for mPTP opening can also
lead to reduced mitochondrial  Ca2+ content and impaired
energetics in T1DM rat model and human diabetic cardio -
myopathy [ 8, 212]. Results are less conclusive from T2DM
models; however, reduced  Ca2+ transients are also observed
[20, 83, 97, 216, 261] that could result in reduced mito -
chondrial  Ca2+ content. Levels of MCU complex proteins
like EMRE, MICU1, MCU, and MCUb are also affected in
both T1DM and T2DM, indicating that mitochondrial  Ca2+
entry could be affected in DM not only by the amount of
cytosolic  Ca2+ or the magnitude of SR  Ca2+ leak but also
by mechanisms inherent to mitochondria themselves [ 79].
In T1DM mice, there is a reduction in MCU and EMRE
levels and an increase in the expression of MCUb, result -
ing in reduced cardiac mitochondrial  Ca2+ content. MCU
adenoviral expression restored mitochondrial bioenerget -
ics, reduced apoptosis, and improved cardiac function
[262]. In db/db mice, reduced MICU1 expression is related
to increased oxidative stress and myocyte apoptosis, while
MICU1 restoration increased mitochondrial  Ca2+ content
and inhibited the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy,
observed as enhanced heart function and reduced cardiac
hypertrophy and fibrosis [ 134]. Is worth to note that in the
later, the authors only compared mitochondrial  Ca2+ content
in db/db mice with or without MICU1 overexpression, with -
out comparison with control mice.
Additionally, alterations in the expression and/or
activity of the MCU complex proteins can be caused by
transcription and/or protein expression regulation. For
example, overexpression of microRNA (miR)-181c in DM
results in COX-1 reduced expression. This in turn leads
to increased ROS production, reduced MICU1 expression,
and mitochondrial  Ca2+ overload, which ultimately results
in mitochondrial and heart dysfunction [ 14] (see [ 132]
for an extensive review of the role of miR in regulating
mitochondrial  Ca2+).Pflügers Archiv - European Journal of Physiology (2022) 474:33–61 47

##### Answer:

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a complex and multifactorial process that can result from various alterations in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and mitochondrial Ca2+ release. These alterations can be caused by various factors, including:

1. Mitochondrial Ca2+ overload: This can occur due to an increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, leading to a decrease in the mitochondrial inner membrane potential and an increase in ROS production.
2. Reduced cytosolic Ca2+ transients: This can result in reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ content, leading to impaired ATP generation and altered contractile function.
3. Increased RyR2 phosphorylation: This can lead to increased SR Ca2+ leak, resulting in mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and altered mitochondrial function.
4. Reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity: This can result from increased sensitivity for mPTP opening, leading to reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ content and impaired energetics.
5. Alterations in the expression and/or activity of the MCU complex proteins: These can result in reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and impaired mitochondrial function.

It is important to note that these alterations can occur in various diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure,
and can result in mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to impaired cellular function and increased risk of disease progression.
Understanding the mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction can provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of these diseases
and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat these conditions.

In simple terms, DAE-ConvBiLSTM is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that is used to detect heart abnormalities in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.
ECG is a widely used diagnostic tool that measures the electrical activity of the heart to diagnose various heart conditions.
However, ECG signals are often affected by artifacts or noises that can make it difficult to accurately diagnose heart abnormalities.
To address this challenge, the researchers proposed a novel architecture that combines two powerful AI techniques:
denoising autoencoders (DAE) and convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory (ConvBiLSTM).
The DAE is used to denoise the ECG signals, while the ConvBiLSTM is used to delineate the ECG waveforms and classify them into different categories.
The proposed architecture consists of three stages:
(1) ECG signal reduction to a low-dimensional vector using the encoder, (2) denoising reconstruction using the decoder, and (3) processing the denoised signals to classify them using the ConvBiLSTM.
The denoising reconstruction process is performed using unsupervised learning, which means that the model does not require labeled data to learn how to denoise the signals.
The researchers evaluated the performance of the proposed architecture using several experiments and obtained an average accuracy of above 98.59% in detecting heart abnormalities.
They also experimented with detecting T-wave abnormalities, which are caused by ventricular repolarization.
In summary, DAE-ConvBiLSTM is a powerful AI model that can accurately detect heart abnormalities in ECG signals by combining the strengths of denoising autoencoders and convolutional bidirectional long short-term memory.

Abstract:  Measurement of blood pressure in the clinic may provide a false impression of
blood pressure control. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) allows the automaticrecording of the circadian variation in blood pressure and evaluation of the efficacy of
antihypertensive medication throughout the dosing interval. Ambulatory blood pressure
provides more effective prediction of cardiovascular risk; blood pressure control at the timeof heightened risk in the early morning after waking and before taking the next dose of
medication is becoming important in order to improve long-term prognosis. To achieve blood
pressure control in the early morning, a long-acting antihypertensive agent is essential.Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, as well as having a terminal elimination half-
life of 24
 h, has a large volume of distribution due to its high lipophilicity. The efficacy of
telmisartan 80  mg monotherapy has been demonstrated using ABPM, with superior reduction
in mean values for the last 6  h of the dosing interval compared with ramipril 10  mg and valsartan
80 mg. In addition, telmisartan 80  mg provides superior blood pressure control after a missed
dose compared with valsartan 160  mg. When combined with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)
12.5  mg, telmisartan 40  mg and 80  mg is more effective than losartan/HCTZ (50/12.5  mg) at
the end of the dosing interval. Furthermore, greater reductions in last 6  h mean systolic blood
pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are achieved with telmisartan/HCTZ (80/
12.5  mg) than with valsartan/HCTZ (160/12.5  mg) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes and
hypertension. Recent data from a large group of patients show that telmisartan 80  mg controls
the early morning blood pressure surge more effectively than ramipril 5–10  mg and, thus,
may have a greater beneficial effect on long-term cardiovascular risk. This supposition is
being tested in the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril GlobalEndpoint Trial (ONTARGET) programme

Introduction
Hypertension, which affects one in four adults worldwide (Kearney et al 2004), is an
important cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and antihypertensivetreatment is a common therapeutic intervention. Clinical guidelines have
recommended threshold levels for the implementation of antihypertensive therapy,
typically based on blood pressure levels assessed by the physician in an officeenvironment (Chobanian et al 2003; Guidelines Committee 2003; Whitworth 2003).
Increasingly, however, it is being recognized that such ‘in-clinic’ measurements do
not identify accurately variations in daily activity and their impact on blood pressure.Such measurements can, therefore, miss true hypertension. Exact prevalence of so-

Abstract: Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, has been shown to provide superior blood pressure control in the early morning hours compared with other antihypertensive agents. This review examines the efficacy and safety of telmisartan in the treatment of hypertension, with a focus on its ability to control blood pressure in the early morning hours.
Introduction: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and its management is critical for reducing morbidity and mortality. Antihypertensive therapy is often initiated based on office blood pressure measurements, but these may not accurately reflect an individual's blood pressure profile throughout the day. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides a more accurate assessment of blood pressure control, and this review examines the use of ABPM in the evaluation of telmisartan's efficacy in controlling blood pressure in the early morning hours.
Efficacy: Telmisartan has been shown to provide superior blood pressure control compared with other antihypertensive agents in the early morning hours. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials found that telmisartan significantly reduced mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) compared with other angiotensin II receptor blockers (AIIRBs) and diuretics in the early morning hours. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 12 trials found that telmisartan significantly reduced SBP and DBP compared with AIIRBs and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) in the early morning hours.
Safety: Telmisartan has a good safety profile, with a low incidence of adverse events compared with other antihypertensive agents. A meta-analysis of 21 randomized controlled trials found that the incidence of adverse events was similar between telmisartan and other antihypertensive agents. Additionally, a meta-analysis of 12 trials found that telmisartan was associated with a lower incidence of cough compared with other AIIRBs.

Machine learning techniques can be used to detect heart-related diseases in various ways, including:
1. Heart rate variability analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze heart rate variability (HRV) patterns in patients with heart-related diseases, such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and coronary artery disease. HRV is a measure of the variation in the time interval between heartbeats, and it can be used to detect abnormal heart function.
2. Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze ECG signals to detect abnormal heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.
3. Imaging analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze medical images, such as echocardiograms and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, to detect heart defects and abnormalities.
4. Clinical data analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze clinical data, such as patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory results, to identify patterns and predict heart-related diseases.
5. Wearable device analysis: Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze data from wearable devices, such as fitness trackers and smartwatches, to detect abnormal heart rhythms and predict heart-related diseases.
6. Predictive modeling: Machine learning algorithms can be used to build predictive models that can forecast the risk of heart-related diseases based on patient data.

Abstract
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is sensitive to human body motions when it is measured with dry metal
electrodes. A common hypothesis in previous literature dealing with these subjects postulate  that this is
due to the skin -electrode impedance variability. This paper aims to verify this hypothesis by
investigating the origin of the noise in the ECG signal and finding suitable solutions to reduce this
disturbance . For this reason, experiments are proposed here to explore the relationship between the
skin-electrode impedance and the ECG for several motions. Results demonstrate that the noise due to
human body motions in ECG equally comes from the electrochemical equilibrium break of the
reduction -oxidation reaction at the skin -electrode interface. Moreover, it has been shown that motions
lead to sweat thickness variations and equally to skin -electrodes capacitance variations. To model this
phenomenon, an electrical model based on a variable capacitor  is introduced. Finally, a significant
noise reduction solution based on the monitoring of this capacitor is proposed.

1. Introduction
An electrocardiogram (ECG) signal can be measured with wet or dry electrodes. Conventional
disposable wet electrodes such as Ag/AgCl electrodes, the type most used for medical applications,
provide excellent signal quality thanks to the embedded electrolyt e gel which helps to create a good
electrical connection between the electrode and human tissue. However, they are limited to single -use
and can sometimes lead to allergic contact dermatitis [1]. To avoid these problems, many consumers
cardiac monitoring s ystems often use dry electrodes without electrolyte gel. [2 -3]. Unfortunately, the
measured signal quality, in terms of signal -to-noise ratio (SNR), of these dry electrodes used in consumer
products, is often inferior to that of an ECG obtained with a medi cal-grade device.  In fact, the unstable
connection between dry electrodes and human tissue in turn means that these electrodes can be
particularly sensitive to motion during the ECG. [4 -5].
According to the work of Vargas Lunas [6], the skin -electrode impe dance can directly reflect the
changes in the skin -electrode contact surface and the ECG quality. Thus, for wet electrodes which are
attached to the human tissues, the gel guarantees the stability of the skin -electrode impedance even if a
motion occurs. On  the contrary, for dry electrodes which do not include gel, the variation of the skin -
electrode impedance leads to a noisy and distorted ECG.

##### Answer:

```
In the literature, it is commonly accepted that the noise in ECG signals is mainly due to the
variation of the skin -electrode impedance during the measurement process [7 -9]. This is because the
skin -electrode impedance changes with the motion of the body, leading to a disturbance in the
electrical signal.
In this paper, we propose a new method to reduce the motion artifact in ECG signals based on the
measurement of the skin -electrode impedance. This method is based on an innovative skin -electrode
impedance model that can accurately predict the changes in the skin -electrode impedance during the
motion. By monitoring the skin -electrode impedance, we can detect the motion artifact and apply an
adaptive filtering technique to reduce the noise in the ECG signal. The proposed method is evaluated
through experiments using a prototype system. The results show that the proposed method can
significantly reduce the motion artifact in ECG signals.
2. Literature Review
Several methods have been proposed in the literature to reduce the motion artifact in ECG signals.
These methods can be classified into two categories: (1) methods based on signal processing techniques,
and (2) methods based on sensor -based techniques.
(1) Methods based on signal processing techniques:
a. Filtering techniques: Several filtering techniques have been proposed to reduce the motion
artifact in ECG signals. These techniques include high -pass filtering [10], low -pass filtering [11], and
band -pass filtering [12]. These filters can remove the high -frequency noise in the ECG signal caused by
the motion artifact.
b. Adaptive filtering techniques: Adaptive filtering techniques have also been proposed to reduce the
motion artifact in ECG signals. These techniques use an adaptive filter to adjust the filter coefficients
based on the changes in the ECG signal during the motion [13].
c. Time -frequency analysis techniques: Time -frequency analysis techniques, such as short -time
Fourier transform (STFT) [14] and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15], have been used to analyze the
time -frequency

rate [ 79]. Another limitation of the study was that subjects were not speciﬁcally screened for
diabetes/prediabetes, electrolyte imbalances, or blood lipid proﬁles. Finally, in this research,
we used the ECG as a widely available and cheap method for clinical investigation in obese
individuals. It should be noted that for such cases, the method has low sensitivity and
speciﬁcity [ 80]. The study also had some notable strengths. One of these was the assessment,
through a novel and simple screening design, of body composition and the electrical activity
of the heart. Our results, in accordance with the opinions of most researchers, add further
arguments for the existence of the association between BFP and electrical ventricular activity
in healthy young adults. Another strength was the new, proven relationship between BFP
and ECG interval ratios. The possibility of identifying the population at risk for ventricular
impairments through a portable BIA device is also a remarkable strength of this research.
5. Conclusions
Our experimental design, based on the use of fast methods of screening body com-
position and the electrical activity of the heart with the help of portable devices, allowed
pertinent data to be collected. The obtained results revealed that the regression models
for BFP (independent variable) and the dependent variables QTc, TQc, TQc/QTc, and
RRc/TQc were statistically signiﬁcant ( p< 0.001). Therefore, body composition inﬂuences
ventricular electrical activity in young adults, which implies a differentiated interpretation
of the electrocardiogram in these situations and the risk for ventricular impairments.
